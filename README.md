# CALCULATOR APP USER INTERFACE

Started a new flutter project. 
This is the part of my flutter learnings. 
First page that I built independently without any guided tutorial.
## How to run?

Make sure you have installed all the dependencies for flutter.

Connect a device and run the command

flutter run
